## Configuration

## Usage

### React

```TypeScript
import {
  Timeline,
  TimelineRow,
  TimelineModel,
  TimelineOptions,
} from "animation-timeline-js";

const model = { rows: [] as Array<TimelineRow> } as TimelineModel;
const options = {
  id: "timeline",
  rowsStyle: {
    height: 35,
  } as TimelineRowStyle,
} as TimelineOptions;

const timeline = new Timeline(options, model);
```

### Outline list

Outline list\tree can implemented as a separate HTML component and synchronized with the timeline.
See the [live demo](https://ievgennaida.github.io/animation-timeline-control/)

## Model

Read only and defined by the interfaces:

- TimelineModel
- TimelineRow
- TimelineKeyframe

### Events

| Event name      | description                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| timeChanged     | time changed. source can be used to check event sender. args type: TimelineTimeChangedEvent |
| selected        | keyframe is selected. args type: TimelineSelectedEvent                                      |
| scroll          | On scroll. args type: TimelineScrollEvent                                                   |
| dragStarted     | emitted on drag started. args type: TimelineDragEvent                                       |
| drag            | emitted when dragging. args type: TimelineDragEvent                                         |
| dragFinished    | emitted when drag finished. args type: TimelineDragEvent                                    |
| KeyframeChanged | emitted when drag finished. args type: TimelineKeyframeChangedEvent                         |

Events can be prevented by calling args.preventDefault()

Example of the type strict event subscription:

```TypeScript
this.timeline.onDragStarted((args: TimelineDragEvent) => {
    if (args) {
    }
});
```

### Timeline units and position

Time indicator position can be changed by a method call:

```JavaScript
timeline.setTime(1000);
```

Current time can be fetched by a method call or by an event:
```TypeScript
let units = timeline.getTime();

timeline.onTimeChanged((event: TimelineTimeChangedEvent) => {
  if(event.source !== TimelineEventSource.User) {
    units = event.var;
  }
});
```

Displayed units text can be changed by overriding a method:

```JavaScript
timeline._formatUnitsText = (val)=> { return val + ' ms'; };
```

### Styling

Styles are applied by a global settings and can be overridden by a row or keyframe style.

## Changes

## > 2.0

- Migrated to TypeScript, Webpack, Babel.
- API is refined.

  npm install
```

to pack JavaScript as a bundle:

```bash
  npm run build
```

### Debug

VSCode can be used to debug the component with the next extensions:

- Debugger for Chrome
- Live HTML Previewer.

Also embedded chrome debugger can be used when demo page is running.

### Build Tests

To build TypeScript unittests command should be executed:

```bash
  npm run build-tests
```

### Run Tests

Tests execution can be started by opening tests/unittests.html.
Mocha test libs are hosted on the internet, so connection is required.
